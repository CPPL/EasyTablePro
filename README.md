# EasyTable Pro

## General

EasyTable Pro is a standard Joomla component that allows you to import small to very large tables into Joomla. It does this by importing records from CSV files (exported from Excel, Filemaker, Access etc) and creating a matching table in the MySQL database used by Joomla.

The benefits of this are that very large tables (only limited by your database server) can be loaded into your Joomla website.

For more information - please read about it at [the original website See People Software](https://seepeoplesoftware.com/products/easytable-pro.html).

## License
The software is GPL'd like all software that appears on [Joomla Extension Directory](https://extensions.joomla.org).

At this writing ( _21 Dec 2016_ ) [EasyTable Pro is still listed](https://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/extension/news-display/tables-a-lists/easytable-pro) but as we're no longer developing Joomla software and the [upcoming changes to the JED](https://extensions.joomla.org/blog/item/faq-about-joomla-update-system-requirement) we expect it will eventually be removed.
